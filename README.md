## README for Educative Class on GraphQL

Source: https://www.educative.io/courses/full-stack-applications-with-graphql/YQ5GonBZLMp

### Summary
Really good course that features GraphQL on server (Apollo Server) using data stored in a file (data/data.js), then progresses to integrate with a MongoDB database via Mongoose before adding a React front-end (Apollo client). However, I run into errors when trying to switch my resolvers.js to retrieving data from Mongo rather than from the file (data/data.js).

To run the project:
```npm run start```
